"""Authorization helpers for the Feast MCP server.

The MCP server does not enforce its own RBAC — it forwards the caller's
bearer token to the upstream Feast feature server, which validates the
token (OIDC / Kubernetes SA token) and applies its own permission model.

Two modes are supported:

1. **No auth** (default, or ``--auth-mode passthrough``):
   No authentication required — connections are accepted without tokens.
   Useful for development or when the client already holds a valid token.

2. **OIDC login** (``--auth-mode oidc``):
   An OIDCProxy discovers endpoints from the OIDC discovery URL
   (the same ``auth_discovery_url`` used in Feast's feature_store.yaml)
   and presents a browser login flow so that IDE clients (Cursor, VS Code,
   etc.) can sign the user in.  After login the upstream access token is
   stored server-side and forwarded to Feast on every tool call.

   Programmatic clients (MCP SDK, demo scripts) can also send OIDC
   provider tokens directly as Bearer tokens — the server validates them
   against the provider's JWKS as a fallback.
